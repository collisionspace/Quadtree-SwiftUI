# Clustering with Quadtrees - SwiftUI

With this codebase I've been working on playing around with new techniques and ways of doing things so it could be a little messy

So for this clustering with Quadtrees, I decided to add a layer over mapkit so if I wanted to 
switch it out for Google Maps, Mapbox or another mapping provider it should be relevantly easy

If over the 180th meridian (international dateline in the pacific) then there is issues. 
I haven't fixed that yet but to fix it there needs to be 2 rects/box on both sides of it
